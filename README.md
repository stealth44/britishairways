planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently
and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.


Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. 
Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.
